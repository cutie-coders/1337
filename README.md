### How-To:
Download the git client, found here: https://git-scm.com/ | Click the download for windows, And run the install process. Just use recommended settings, always worked for me.
Next, clone the Repository. At the top you will see a green button called `Code`. Click this, and a url should appear inside the new dropdown. Click the clipboard button next to it to copy it to your clipboard.
Open file explorer, go to the desired repository, and in the top bar (the file path) type `cmd`. This will open a new command prompt window iside that folder.
Now you want to type: `git clone URL` where URL is the url that you just copied. This will download (clone) the repository, and give you a local copy. You can edit this as much as you want.
If there is ever an update (which there will be,) simply do the same steps from above (type cmd in the file path) and this time type `git pull`. This will pull any changes from the repo, including new files, changed files, and anything else that may have changed.
